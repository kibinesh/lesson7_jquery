Extra Credit 

I added a roasted Potato Recipe for the extra credit section. The app has the following features.

1. All ingriendents or instructions will be visible when clicked, and will be hidden when clicked again. I used toggle()  and next () to achieve that
2. When hovering, the hovered element will be on focus by way of having a border and respective details are displayed. Once the mouse leaves the element it will go back to the default state. I used CSS() border property and Animate() for that.
